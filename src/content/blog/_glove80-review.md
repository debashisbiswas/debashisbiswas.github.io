This is a review of the Glove80 after having used the Kinesis Advantage360 for
about a year and a half.

The Advantage360 is a great keyboard, and helped me quite a bit while I was
trying to fix issues in my arm and wrist. I am grateful for this, as my issues
were getting to the point where I was wondering if my software career was going
to be cut short in year one. This keyboard may have saved my career.

However, as sentimental as this keyboard is to me, it's not without its flaws.
Most reviews will point out that, while the 360 might be one of the comfortable
ergonomic keyboards on the market, it has flaws which you would not expect from
a product of this price point. At nearly $500, you'd expect perfection.

One such flaw is bluetooth connectivity: the two halves of the keyboard can have
issues connecting to each other, and sometimes issues connecting to your
computer. One morning, I spent 10 minutes trying to get the two halves to
connect before I could start working. Out of frustration, I went straight to the
Moergo website and ordered the Glove80, which I kept seeing in reviews (TODO:
link reviews here).*

I've been using the Glove80 for a just over a week. First impression? The
Glove80 is an amazing keyboard, and *it solves every single issue I had with
the Advantage360 Pro*.

Seriously. It's like MoErgo was feeling the exact same issues with the existing
keyboards on the market, and then precisely designed around solving each of
those issues.

Let's start with bluetooth, since this is what got me to buy this keyboard in
the first place.

## Bluetooth

The bluetooth just works, exactly as you'd expect. I pull the two halves of the
keyboard out of the travel case, turn them on, and start working within seconds.
No more back and forth with "turn the left half on first, wait one second, pray
to the bluetooth gods, turn on the right half, realize it didn't work, start
over" (360 users know what I'm talking about) - just turn the keyboard on and
start working.

As it should be.

## Ergonomics

- no so high on the desk
- thumb cluster
- nice pinky positioning

## Software

- with a programmable keyboard, you're not just getting the hardware, you also
  want good software
- layout editor
- fast build times

## Travel case

- it has one

## Feeling

- actually a pleasure to type on. the 360 is okay but doesn't feel amazing - I
  thought this tradeoff was necessary for ergonomics. the cherry blossoms feel
  amazing though. this is highly personal - the light chocs aren't for everyone,
  but as a musician, it's fun because I can practice absolute minimum movement

## Downsides

- Tenting, but I understand the tradeoff
