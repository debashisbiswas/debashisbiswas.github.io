A few years ago, I had a dismissive opinion of marketing. It went something like
this:

> You don't need marketing. Just build a good product. It'll speak for itself,
and once you've solved a problem that people have, they'll naturally discover
it.

You've probably heard something similar before. Maybe you've held this opinion
at one point. It's a common idea from those of us who spend more time creating
than selling.

Since then, I've changed my opinion on this. Because people can't engage with
something when _they don't know it exists_. Sure, if your product is any good,
maybe they'll "naturally discover" it. But only if it's somewhere where they can
find it.

At the core, that's all marketing is: letting people know you exist.
