In periods that I'm consistent with a writing practice and writing evergreen
notes, I find that the tools I use to write have a meaningful influence on how I
conceptualize ideas. Whenever I'm thinking about an idea, I'll "see" the
Obsidian interface in my mind: title at the top, linked mentions at the bottom,
backlinks in purple...

This is interesting because the interface changes how I think even when I'm not
using it. It turns a thought process that's normally abstract into something
more concrete - something my visual memory can participate in. How might we
intentionally design for this property in our software?
