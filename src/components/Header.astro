          I'm a software engineer with nearly a decade of experience in backend, automation,
          developer tooling, web, and mobile projects. I currently spend most of my time using
          TypeScript and Python, and I'm comfortable in other languages as well.
        </p>

          During my Master's, I primarily studied cybersecurity: binary analysis and exploitation,
          reverse engineering, and network security.

          In my free time, I've recently been exploring real-time distributed systems for music
          applications, programming language and type theory, design and UX, and infrastructure as
          code.
        </p>
        <p>I also play music, and I have a degree in clarinet performance!</p>
