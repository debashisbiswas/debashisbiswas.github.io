          I'm a software engineer. I currently spend most of my time using Elixir, TypeScript, and
          Python, and I'm comfortable in other languages as well.

          I completed my MS in Computer Science at Arizona State University, where I primarily
          studied cybersecurity: binary analysis and exploitation, reverse engineering, and network
          security.

          I'm also a classically-trained clarinetist, and I completed my BMus in Clarinet
          Performance at Arizona State University. I've studied with
          <!-- Avoid extra whitespace from formatter adding line breaks. -->

          In addition to the clarinet, I also play the bass clarinet, contra-alto clarinet, and
          contrabass clarinet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, I also repair musical instruments! I studied instrument repair with Dr. Steve
          Prescott, a well-known repairperson in the clarinet community. I primarily focus on
          clarinet repair, though I've done a bit of work on flutes and saxophones.

          Some of my other interests include calisthenics, cooking, language learning, note-taking
          systems, ergonomic keyboards, type theory, (neo)vim, Linux, and NixOS.
