  <section class="space-y-4">
    <p>
      I've taken inspiration from quite a few different places. While it's difficult to be
      exhaustive, this page lists out influences that have changed my perspective or shaped my work
      in a meaningful way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of these inspirations are recent, and many are from my childhood. I believe there's
      something important about holding on to the things that inspired us as children.
    </p>

      <blockquote class="mb-2 border-s-4 border-zinc-200 ps-2 italic text-zinc-900">
        Regardless of the circumstances, human capacity has its limits, and when too much happens,
        it’s easy to feel like giving up on our dreams. It's only natural to prioritize daily life;
        after all, it’s reality that gives rise to our dreams.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yet, as those dreams get worn down by the harshness of everyday life, I often hoped you could
        recall the dreams you had before facing those challenges. It may be presumptuous of me, but I
        believe that the aspirations you had as a child are incredibly important.
